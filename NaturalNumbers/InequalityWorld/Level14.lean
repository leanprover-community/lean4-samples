## Level 14: `add_le_add_left`

I know these are easy and we've done several already, but this is one
of the axioms for an ordered commutative monoid! The nature of formalizing
is that we should formalize all "obvious" lemmas, and then when we're
actually using `≤` in real life, everything will be there. Note also,
of course, that all of these lemmas are already formalized in Lean's
maths library, for Lean's inbuilt natural numbers.

## Lemma: `add_le_add_left`
If `a ≤ b` then for all `t`, `t+a ≤ t+b`.

theorem add_le_add_left {a b : MyNat} (h : a ≤ b) (t : MyNat) :
  t + a ≤ t + b := by
  cases h with
  | _ c hc =>
    use c
    rw [hc]
    rw [add_assoc]
