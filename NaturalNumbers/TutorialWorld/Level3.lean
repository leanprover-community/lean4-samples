## Level 3: Peano's axioms

The import above gives us the type `MyNat` of natural numbers. But it also gives us some other things,
which we'll take a look at now:

- a term `0 : MyNat`, interpreted as the `MyNat.zero`.
- a function `succ : MyNat → MyNat`, with `succ n` interpreted as "the number after n", or the successor of `n`.
- The principle of mathematical induction.

These axioms are essentially the axioms isolated by Peano which uniquely characterize the natural
numbers (you also need recursion, but you can ignore it for now). The first axiom says that `0` is a
natural number. The second says that there is a `succ` function which eats a number and spits out the
number after it, so `succ 0 = 1`, `succ 1 = 2`, and so on.

Peano's last axiom is the principle of mathematical induction. This is a deeper fact. It says that
if you have infinitely many true/false statements `P(0)`, `P(1)`, `P(2)`, and so on, and if
`P(0)` is true, and if for every natural number `d` you know that `P(d)` implies `P(succ d)`, then
`P(n)` must be true for every natural number `n`.
It's like saying that if you have a long line of dominoes, and if you knock the first one down, and
if you know that if a domino falls down then the one after it will fall down too, then you can
deduce that all the dominos will fall down. You can also think of it as saying that every natural
number can be built by starting at `0` and then applying `succ` a finite number of times.

Peano's insights were firstly that these axioms completely characterise the natural numbers, and
secondly that these axioms alone can be used to build a whole bunch of other structure on the
natural numbers, for example addition, multiplication and so on.

This world is all about seeing how far these axioms of Peano can take us.

Let's practice your use of the `rewrite` tactic in the following example. The hypothesis `h` is a proof that
`succ a = b` and you want to prove that `succ (succ a) = succ b`. In words, you're going to prove that if
`b` is the number after `a` then `succ b` is the number after `succ a`. Now here's a tricky question. If
your goal is `⊢ succ (succ a) = succ b`, and your hypothesis is `h : succ a = b`, then what will the goal
change to when we type `rewrite [h]`?

## Lemma

If `succ a = b`, then `succ (succ a) = succ b`.

lemma example3 (a b : MyNat) (h : (succ a) = b) : succ (succ a) = succ b := by
  rewrite [h]
  rfl

Remember that `rewrite [h]` will look for the left hand side of `h` in the goal, and will replace it with
the right hand side. Try and figure out how the goal will change, and then try it.

The answer: Lean changed `succ a` into `b`, so the goal became `succ b = succ b`. That goal is of
the form `X = X`, so you can complete prove the proof using `rfl` which `rw` does for you.

Important note: the tactic `rewrite` expects a proof afterwards (e.g. `rewrite [h1]`).
But `rfl` is just `rfl`.

You may be wondering whether you could have just substituted in the definition of `b` and proved the
goal that way. To do that, you would want to replace the right hand side of `h` with the left hand
side. You do this in Lean by writing `rw [← h]`. You get the left-arrow by typing `\l` and then a space;
note that this is a small letter `L`, not a number `1`. You can just edit your proof and try it.

You may also be wondering why we keep writing `succ b` instead of `b + 1`. This is because we haven't
defined addition yet! On the next level, the final level of Tutorial World, we will introduce
addition, and then you'll be ready to enter Addition World.

Now you are ready for [Level4.lean](./Level4.lean.md).
