# Function World

## Level 9: a big maze

In [Proposition World](../PropositionWorld.lean.md) you will see a variant of this example
which can be solved by a tactic. It would be an interesting project to make a tactic
which could automatically solve this sort of level in Lean.

You can of course work both forwards and backwards, or you could crack and draw a picture.

## Definition
Given a bunch of functions, we can define another one.

/-!
Here we finish this proof with a new tactic `assumption` instead of `exact a`.
The [`assumption` tactic](../Tactics/assumption.lean.md) tries to solve the goal using a
hypothesis of compatible type.  Since we have the hypothesis named `a` it finds
it and completes the proof.

That's the end of Function World! Next it's [Proposition World](../PropositionWorld.lean.md), and
the tactics you've learnt in Function World are enough to solve all nine levels! In fact, the levels
in [Proposition World](../PropositionWorld.lean.md) might look strangely familiar...
