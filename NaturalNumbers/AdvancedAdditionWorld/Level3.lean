## Level 3: `succ_eq_succ_of_eq`

We are going to prove something completely obvious: if `a=b` then
`succ a = succ b`. This is *not* `succ_inj`!
This is trivial -- we can just rewrite our proof of `a=b`.
But how do we get to that proof? Use the `intro` tactic.

## Theorem
For all naturals `a` and `b`, `a = b ⟹ succ a = succ b`.
