## Level 7: `add_right_cancel_iff`

It's sometimes convenient to have the "if and only if" version
of theorems like `add_right_cancel`. Remember that you can use `constructor`
to split an `↔` goal into the `→` goal and the `←` goal.

## Pro tip:

Notice `exact add_right_cancel _ _ _` means "let Lean figure out the missing inputs"
so we don't have to spell it out like we did in Level 6.

## Theorem
For all naturals `a`, `b` and `t`, `a + t = b + t ↔ a = b.`
