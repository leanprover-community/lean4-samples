# Advanced Addition World

## Level 5: `add_right_cancel`

The theorem `add_right_cancel` is the theorem that you can cancel on the right
when you're doing addition -- if `a + t = b + t` then `a = b`. After `intro h`
I'd recommend induction on `t`. Don't forget that `rw [add_zero] at h` can be used
to do rewriting of hypotheses rather than the goal.

## Theorem
On the set of natural numbers, addition has the right cancellation property.
In other words, if there are natural numbers `a`, `b` and `c` such that
`a + t = b + t` then we have `a = b`.
