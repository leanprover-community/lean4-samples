## Level 4: `mul_left_cancel`

This is the last of the bonus multiplication levels. `mul_left_cancel` will be useful in inequality
world.

People find this level hard. I have probably had more questions about this level than all the other
levels put together. Many levels in this game can just be solved by "running at it" -- do
induction on one of the variables, keep your head, and you're done. In fact, if you like a
challenge, it might be instructive if you stop reading after the end of this paragraph and try
solving this level now by induction, seeing the trouble you run into, and reading the rest of these
comments afterwards. This level has a sting in the tail. If you are a competent mathematician, try
and figure out what is going on. Write down a maths proof of the theorem in this level. Exactly what
statement do you want to prove by induction? It is subtle.

Ok so here are some spoilers. The problem with naively running at it, is that if you try induction
on, say, `c`, then you are imagining `a` and `b` as fixed, and your inductive hypothesis `P(c)` is
`ab=ac ⟹ b=c`. So for your inductive step you will be able to assume `ab=ad ⟹ b=d` and your goal
will be to show `ab=a(d+1) ⟹ b=d+1`. When you also assume `ab=a(d+1)` you will realize that your
inductive hypothesis is *useless*, because `ab=ad` is not true! The statement `P(c)` (with `a` and
`b` regarded as constants) is not provable by induction.

What you *can* prove by induction is the following *stronger* statement. Imagine `a ≠ 0` as fixed,
and then prove "for all `b`, if `ab=ac` then `b=c`" by induction on `c`. This gives us the extra
flexibility we require. Note that we are quantifying over all `b` in the inductive hypothesis -- it
is essential that `b` is not fixed.

You can do this in two ways in Lean -- before you start the induction you can write `revert b`. The
`revert` tactic is the opposite of the `intro` tactic; it replaces the `b` in the hypotheses with
"for all `b`" in the goal.

Alternatively, you can write `induction c generalizing b with` as the first line of the proof.

If you do not modify your technique in this way, then this level seems
to be impossible (judging by the comments I've had about it!)

## Theorem
If `a ≠ 0`, `b` and `c` are natural numbers such that `ab = ac`, then `b = c`.
