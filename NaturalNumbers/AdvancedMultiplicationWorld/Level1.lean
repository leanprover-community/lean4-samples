## Level 1: `mul_pos`

Recall that if `b : MyNat` is a hypothesis and you do `cases b with`,
your one goal will split into two goals,
namely the cases `b = 0` and `b = succ n`. So `cases` here is like
a weaker version of induction (you don't get the inductive hypothesis).

## Tricks

1) if your goal is `⊢ X ≠ Y` then `intro h` will give you `h : X = Y` and
a goal of `⊢ False`. This is because `X ≠ Y` *means* `(X = Y) → False`.
Conversely if your goal is `False` and you have `h : X ≠ Y` as a hypothesis
then `apply h` will work backwards and turn the goal into `X = Y`.

2) if `hab : succ (3 * x + 2 * y + 1) = 0` is a hypothesis and your goal is `⊢ False`,
then `exact succ_ne_zero _ hab` will solve the goal, because Lean will figure
out that `_` is supposed to be `3 * x + 2 * y + 1`.

# Theorem
