# Tactic cases

`cases` is similar to `induction` only it drops the inductive hypothesis.

Assuming `x` is a variable in the local context with an inductive type,
`cases x` splits the main goal, producing one goal for each constructor of the
inductive type, in which the target is replaced by a general instance of that constructor.
If the type of an element in the local context depends on `x`,
that element is reverted and reintroduced afterward,
so that the case split affects that hypothesis as well.
`cases` detects unreachable cases and closes them automatically.

For example, given `n : Nat` and a goal with a hypothesis `h : P n` and target `Q n`,
`cases n` produces one goal with hypothesis `h : P 0` and target `Q 0`,
and one goal with hypothesis `h : P (Nat.succ a)` and target `Q (Nat.succ a)`.
Here the name `a` is chosen automatically and is not accessible.
You can use `with` to provide the variables names for each constructor.
- `cases e`, where `e` is an expression instead of a variable, generalizes `e` in the goal,
  and then cases on the resulting variable.
- Given `as : List α`, `cases as with | nil => tac₁ | cons a as' => tac₂`,
  uses tactic `tac₁` for the `nil` case, and `tac₂` for the `cons` case,
  and `a` and `as'` are used as names for the new variables introduced.
- `cases h : e`, where `e` is a variable or an expression,
  performs cases on `e` as above, but also adds a hypothesis `h : e = ...` to each hypothesis,
  where `...` is the constructor instance for that particular case.
